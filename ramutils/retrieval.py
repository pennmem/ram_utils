"""RetrievalCreationHelper.py, author = LoganF, updated May 16, 2018

A script used to create retrieval events and their corresponding "deliberation" matches. A deliberation match being
a point in time in a different list where a subject is actively trying, but failing to recall a word.

Works using data formatted for the Kahana Computational Memory Lab.

The code has been built for functionality with all RAM data, scalp ltpFR2, and pyFR. However, the author
only tested out the functionality on the FR1, catFR1, ltpFR2, and pyFR data.

For help please see docstrings (function_name? or help(function_name) or contact LoganF
For errors please contact LoganF

        Array of behavioral events consisting of recalls with matches
        and their corresponding deliberation periods

    Notes
    -----
    Code will do a exact match in time first, afterwards will do a "tolerated" match. Any recalls that
    are not matched are dropped. If there are multiple possibles matches (either exact or tolerated) for a
    recall then the code will select the match that is closest in trial number to the recall.
