# A Brief Guide to RAM Report Pipelines

## The Pipeline

RAM reports are produced by instantiating a `ReportPipeline`
and adding tasks to it in sequence.
The `ReportPipeline` provides
two ways for the tasks to share data:

* Pipeline attributes

  Each RAM Task in the pipeline holds a reference to the pipeline object itself
  in self.pipeline. The subject, task, and mount point are stored as attributes
  of the pipeline, and are accessed in this way

* Object Passing

  The pipeline maintains a dictionary of objects that can be referenced from each
task. To add an object to this dictionary from a Task, call `Task.pass_object(key,value)`.
To retrieve an object, call `Task.get_passed_object(key)`.

Once all the tasks have been added to the pipeline, call `ReportPipeline.execute_pipeline()`
to perform all the tasks.

For each task in the queue, `execute_pipeline` does the following:

* Check the workspace directory for the file `Task_Name.completed`
* If this file exists, call `Task.input_hashsum()` and check for changes to the tasksâ€™
	  dependencies
* If there are no changes, call `Task.restore()`
* If there are changes, or if there is no `.completed` file, call `Task.run()`

## The Report Tasks

The various RAM reports typically follow a common structure:

* Load the events for the subject and experiment
* Load the montage for the subject and experiment
* Load the EEG for the subject and experiment, and compute a spectral decomposition
* Train a classifier on the power matrix, and evaluate its performance
* Assemble any other statistics that should be included in the report
* Generate the relevant graphs
* Fill in the Latex template
* Compile the report into a PDF

Biomarker preparation also follows this pattern, but rather than preparing a PDF report
it saves the classifier and the biomarker parameters as a `.mat` file.

## Some Directories

* `MatlabIO` contains wrappers for spicy.io to convert between Python objects and Matlab structs.
* `PlotUtils` contains a number of convenience classes for producing elegant plots via matplotlib.
  The RAM report pipelines use this module extensively

* `RamPipeline` contains the base pipeline and task classes
* `ReportUtils` contains subclasses from RamPipeline specific to the RAM reports, along with some modules
  used in automated report generation
* `TexUtils` contains code to format matrices nicely in Latex
* `clinical_affairs` contains shell scripts to call the various reports
* `tests` contains all the RAM reporting pipelines, as well as shell scripts for purposes of automation.
