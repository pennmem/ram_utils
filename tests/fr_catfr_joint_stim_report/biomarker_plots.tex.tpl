\caption*{\textbf{(a)} Change in classifier output from the stimulated item (0-1366 ms) to the post-stimulated item (0-1366 ms) plotted for all items and for low-classifier output items. The control group comprises all items from non-stim lists.
\textbf{(b)} Change in recall performance for stimulated items contingent upon whether the stimulated item was presented during a low classifier state or a high classifier state (0-1366 ms).
\textbf{(c)} Change in recall performance for post-stimulated items contingent upon whether the stimulated item was presented during a low classifier state or a high classifier state (0-1366 ms).}
